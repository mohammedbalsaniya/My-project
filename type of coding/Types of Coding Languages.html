            <h1>Types of Coding Languages </h1>
            <p> There are several coding languages used for programming. Some of the most common languages include
                JavaScript,
                Python, C#, C++, and Ruby. What determines the right type of programming language for someone is how
                they plan
                to use it.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>With so many types of programming language options out there, you may be confused as to what these
                individual
                programming languages actually do.</p><br>

            <div>
                <p>As we've referenced before, there are numerous types of coding languages used throughout the globe.
                    What do
                    these coding languages do and how can we group them by usability? Most environments use a model, so
                    that's a
                    good place to start.</p>

            <div>
                <p>A front-end web developer works on the user side of applications. This means that you'll be coding
                    webpages,
                    games, and any software or application that people can see. For example, a front-end web developer
                    most likely
                    coded the webpage that you're reading right now.</p>

            <div>
                <p>It's important to understand the scope of HTML. Without the coding language, web pages wouldn't work.
                    In
                    short, HTML code formats the text, images, and other media that make up a webpage. The language
                    communicates
                    with the computer using a series of attributes and elements. HTML has evolved greatly over time. The
                    language
                    now enables web pages to host videos, sound, and more. It's important to note that HTML couldn't
                    make a very
                    functional webpage by itself.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>The coding language relies heavily on CSS and JavaScript. To make it as simple as possible, think of
                    HTML as
                    the structure of a website while CSS is the style and JavaScript is the functionality. HTML is a
                    highly
                    important coding language that has continued to help shape the internet and web browsing as we know
                    it. </p>

            <a name="CSS">
                <h1>CSS</h1>
            </a>
            <p>CSS or Cascading Style Sheets goes hand in hand with HTML. If HTML is the bread and butter of a website,
                then
                CSS is the package that they come in. CSS takes the text-based website that you've made and applies
                things like
                color, images, videos, and other media to it. CSS makes websites look more appealing to viewers.

                <h1>JavaScript</h1>
            </a>
            <div>
                <p>JavaScript is the knife that actually spreads the butter onto the bread. JavaScript is all about
                    functionality. JavaScript is one of the most popular coding languages in the coding universe right
                    now.
                    JavaScript is also a highly diverse language that can be used to code anything from video games to
                    websites.
                    It
                    can also be used for both mobile and desktop apps. JavaScript was a required skill for over 470,000
                    jobs in
                    tech
                    last year. Potential jobs could include web development, front end development, or JavaScript
                    engineering.</p>

            <p>Python is a general-use programming language meaning that it can be used for almost anything. Python is
                one of
                the most popular programming languages among big tech giants and startups. The language is perfect for
                beginners
                because it rejects complexity and is very simple to learn. Coders who know Python would be eligible for
                jobs in
                back end development, server coding, and more. Popular sites such as Google, Pinterest, Instagram, and
                Dropbox
                were all built using Python. </p>

                <h1>Java</h1>
            </a>
            <p>Not to be confused with JavaScript, Java is a general-purpose coding language that has remained popular
                for
                over 20 years. The main benefit of writing in Java is its versatility. Its philosophy has always been
                “write
                once, run anywhere”. Java is cross-platform compatible and is the basis for most Android operating
                systems. The
                language is favored by industry giants, with over 90% of Fortune 500 companies using Java to build their
                platforms and support their back end systems. Prominent sites that use Java include Facebook, Amazon,
                and Yahoo.

            <a name="Ruby">
                <h1>Ruby</h1>
            </a>
            <p>Ruby is known for having one of the most friendly and widespread coding communities. While learning this
                coding
                language, you'll never be short of helpful mentors to lend a guiding hand during your journey. Ruby is
                unique
                because it runs on the Ruby on Rails framework. The syntax of the language is very straightforward and
                easy to
                comprehend. Companies such as Twitter, Airbnb, Shopify, and thousands of other startups have built their
                platforms using Ruby. Ruby is continuously growing in popularity amongst educational outlets too, as
                many
                different coding educational platforms now specialize on both Ruby and Ruby on Rails framework. </p>
